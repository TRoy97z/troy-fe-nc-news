# Attention!

## Disclaimer (this will be removed)

It still needs some work. Didnt get to work on it as much as I'd like, but the reason why I'm not too worried is because I won't be in the UK post grad for 2 weeks. So I won't be in the first set of applications.

What still needs to be done :

1. error handling (started it but I'll shoot you a message about a question I have)
2. deleteComment is kinda done it only deletes user specific comments but in terms of optimistic rendering I have a point I want to argue.
3. Reusable updateQuery
4. votes fix
5. loading topics
6. more styling (obviously)
